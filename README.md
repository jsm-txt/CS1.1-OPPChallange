BRACKET CREATION TOOL!!!
    This code creates a bracket for either a one on one match or
    two on two team match. Once user selects one or the other, the
    user is asked how many players or teams. These items then fill
    a list that is then randomized to create a bracket order.
    If there is an off nnumber, that remainder player/ team is then
    added to the next round. Once all the rounds are done, the code
    displays stats for each player/team.
